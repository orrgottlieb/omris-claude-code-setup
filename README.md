# Claude Code Setup

A curated public subset of my personal [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) configuration.

This repository contains skills, commands, and hooks that I've developed for my Claude Code workflow. I'm sharing them in case they're useful to others.

## What's Included

### Skills

Skills are reusable technique references and process documentation for Claude Code.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **thorough-planning** | Planning methodology with mandatory success criteria and feedback loops |
| **systematic-debugging** | Hypothesis-driven debugging framework |
| **writing-skills** | Test-driven development approach for creating skills |
| **context-suggest** | Discovers relevant skills, agents, commands, and MCP tools |
| **finding-online-references** | Parallel search agents for GitHub and web research |
| **slidev** | Story-driven technical presentations using Slidev |
| **browser-inspection** | Decision framework for Browser MCP vs DevTools MCP |
| **generate-image** | Image generation using Google's Gemini API |

### Commands

Commands are execution templates invoked with `/command-name`.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **/create-skill** | Guide for creating new skills using TDD methodology |
| **/create-hook** | Analyze project and suggest practical hooks |
| **/handoff-prompt** | Create comprehensive session handoff documents |
| **/refresh-context** | Validate and update project Claude artifacts |

### Hooks

Hooks are shell scripts triggered at specific Claude Code lifecycle events.

| Hook | Event | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **show-session-tips.sh** | SessionStart | Display helpful tips when sessions start |
| **check-context-freshness.sh** | SessionStart | Warn if project context is stale |

### Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **gemini-image** | CLI tool for generating images via Google Gemini API |

## Installation

### Interactive Setup (Recommended)

Clone the repository and run the interactive setup script:

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/omril321/claude-code-setup.git
cd claude-code-setup

# Run interactive setup
./setup.sh
```

The setup script provides:
- **Interactive checkbox menus** to select which skills, commands, and hooks to install
- **Automatic settings.json configuration** for SessionStart hooks
- **Optional gemini-image script installation** with PATH and API key detection
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: `↑↓` to navigate, `space` to toggle, `a` to select all, `n` to deselect all, `enter` to confirm

### Non-Interactive Installation

Install everything without prompts:

```bash
./setup.sh --all
```

Or skip the gemini-image script:

```bash
./setup.sh --all --no-gemini
```

### Uninstall

Remove previously installed items:

```bash
./setup.sh --uninstall
```

### Manual Installation

If you prefer manual installation:

```bash
# Copy skills
cp -R skills/* ~/.claude/skills/

# Copy commands
cp -R commands/* ~/.claude/commands/

# Copy hooks
cp -R hooks/* ~/.claude/hooks/
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/*.sh

# Copy scripts (optional - for generate-image skill)
mkdir -p ~/scripts
cp scripts/gemini-image ~/scripts/
chmod +x ~/scripts/gemini-image
```

### For the gemini-image script

Set your Gemini API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

## Hook Registration

Hooks need to be registered in your `~/.claude/settings.json` to be triggered. Add them under the `hooks` key:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "~/.claude/hooks/show-session-tips.sh"
          },
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "~/.claude/hooks/check-context-freshness.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Hooks are registered under the `hooks` key with a `matcher` (empty string matches all projects) and a nested `hooks` array.

## Skills Not Included

Some skills referenced in the documentation are not included in this public subset:

- **decision-journal** - Capture architectural decisions with context and rationale
- **code-quality-gate** - Architecture, correctness, and readability checklist
- **testing** - Comprehensive testing patterns and framework-specific guidance

If you'd like any of these added, open an issue and I'll consider including them.

## About This Repository

This is a **public subset** of my real Claude Code setup. I maintain a more extensive private configuration that includes work-specific tools and personal preferences.

I'll keep this repository updated as I can, or by request. Feel free to open an issue if you'd like to see additional skills or commands added.
